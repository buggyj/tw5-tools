A variation on the list widget, the taglist widget doesn't have filters - it only lists  tiddlers with a given tag. The resultant list items can be dragged up and down the list causing a re-ordering. Tiddler links can be dragged onto the list, causing that tiddler to be tagged and inserted into the list.

Try out the demo TagListDemo.
