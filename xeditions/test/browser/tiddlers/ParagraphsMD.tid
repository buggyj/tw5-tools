## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes ##

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like
a blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is
considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with
spaces or tabs.

MarkDown offers two styles of headers: *Setext* and *atx*.
Setext-style headers for `<h1>` and `<h2>` are created by
"underlining" with equal signs (`=`) and hyphens (`-`), respectively.
To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (`#`) at the
beginning of the line -- the number of hashes equals the resulting
HTML header level.

Blockquotes are indicated using email-style '`>`' angle brackets.

Markdown:

    A First Level Header
    ====================
    
    A Second Level Header
    ---------------------

    Now is the time for all good men to come to
    the aid of their country. This is just a
    regular paragraph.

    The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
    dog's back.
    
    ### Header 3

    > This is a blockquote.
    > 
    > This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.
    >
    > ## This is an H2 in a blockquote


Output:

    <h1>A First Level Header</h1>
    
    <h2>A Second Level Header</h2>
    
    <p>Now is the time for all good men to come to
    the aid of their country. This is just a
    regular paragraph.</p>
    
    <p>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
    dog's back.</p>
    
    <h3>Header 3</h3>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>This is a blockquote.</p>
        
        <p>This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.</p>
        
        <h2>This is an H2 in a blockquote</h2>
    </blockquote>
