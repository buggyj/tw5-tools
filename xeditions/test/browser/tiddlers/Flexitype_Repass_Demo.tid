title: Flexitype Repass Demo
type: text/vnd.twbase;flexibility=MDL

In the example below text is reparsed. The type is **text/vnd.tiddlywiki;flexiblity=svgtp** - see the tidder [[svgtp]]

This example show how to concatenate data transcluded from an attribute string, something that cannot be done with **text/vnd.tiddlywiki**. In the svg drawing (see AtrStrSource) the path data is transcluded from a field and concatenated with extra data:

`{{AtrStr!!path}} C 800 100 900 100 900 100`

With regular wiki text the concatenation fails and we have

{{AtrStr vnd.tiddlywiki}}

whereas with the reparsed wikitext we have

{{AtrStr}}
