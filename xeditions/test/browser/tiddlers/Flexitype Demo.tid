title: Flexitype Demo
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Flexibility Plugin extends the types supported in tiddlywiki. A regular type for example is ''text/vnd.tiddlywiki''. The extension has the form ''text/vnd.tiddlywiki;flexiblity=Atiddler'' and "Atiddler" contains options to extend tiddlytext or allow text to be reparsed. In the example below text is reparsed. The type is ''text/vnd.tiddlywiki;flexiblity=svgtp'' - see the tidder [[svgtp]]

This example show how to render WikiText in an attribute string, something that cannot be done with ''text/vnd.tiddlywiki''. In the svg drawing the path data is transcluded from a field.
{{AtrStrSource}}

Result is

{{AtrStr}}

The path data is in the path field of AtrStr tiddler and is 

{{AtrStr!!path}}
