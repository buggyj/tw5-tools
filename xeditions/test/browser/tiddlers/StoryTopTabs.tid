Facilitates easier navigating between open tiddlers. 
Links to open tiddlers appear above top of the story river . If 'story mode' is set to zooming (see in appearance tab in the  $:/ControlPanel tiddler)  then the open tiddlers appear in tabs. The top links are controlled from the 'setting' tab in the $:/ControlPanel tiddler.
