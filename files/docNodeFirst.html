<h1>What's up? </h1>
On this web site I write about stuff that interests me, predominantly in the client side web development area -- JavaScript, JSON, CSS, usability, design.

<h2><a href="coffeemaker.html">CoffeeMaker -- a LAMP-based tool for CoffeeScript</a></h2>
<b>July 4, 2011</b><br><br>A CoffeeScript compiler/development tool for LAMP that does not require node.js
<br>CoffeeMaker - compiles your CoffeeScript scripts clientside and caches them on the serverside with no need for a node.js installation. <a href="coffeemaker.html">Also provides an include command.</a>

<h2><a href="sqlike.html">SQLike -- a small query engine</a></h2>
<b>June 1, 2010</b><br><br>
SQLike is a small (10 kB) query engine for JavaScript and ActionScript. Its functionality and syntax is similar to that of SQL and it can be used to query arrays of objects or arrays of arrays. The purpose of <i>SQLike</i> is to provide a tool for this approach that can be used on the clientside in all browsers. <a href="sqlike.html">Start querying your arrays today.</a>

<h2><a href="dynamic_interval.html">Dynamic Interval -- don't call too often</a></h2>
<b>May 16, 2010</b><br><br>This simple little script checks how long it takes to run intervalled functions and then adjusts the intervals if needed, according to how many percent of total application time you are willing to spare. <a href="dynamic_interval.html">Optimize your intervals today.</a>

<h2><a href="theWinOpenerFix.html">Developer friendly tabbed browsing: winOpenerFix.js</a></h2>
<b>May 16, 2008</b><br><br>When you right click a link and choose to open it in a new tab or a new window, it would be nice if the old window would get referenced in the window.opener property. That would give the new window access to the JavaScript and DOM objects from the old window. This happens in IE and Opera, but not in Firefox and Safari. <a href="theWinOpenerFix.html">Here's a fix</a> that hopefully will make it work in those browsers as well.

<h2><a href="javascript_test.html">Are you JavaScript literate? -- A small test</a></h2>
<b>May 14, 2008</b><br><br>
This test tries to evaluate to what extent you’re familiar with some basic concepts and syntax in JavaScript. Suprisingly enough it seems really hard for some people to complete. That is why I have decided to <a href="javascript_test.html">publish it here</a>. Have fun with it. Please comment on it: Could a person fail this test and still be really good at JavaScript?

<h2><a href="sessionvars.html">Session variables without cookies</a></h2>
<b>January 20, 2008</b><br><br>
I've made a small script that let you use JavaScript session variables without using cookies. It will let you store 2 MB of data, with much less hassle than a cookie based solution. <a href="sessionvars.html">Try it out here</a>.

<h2><a href="json_editor.html">My JSON editor</a></h2>
<b>July 5, 2007</b><br><br>The last couple of weeks I've been searching for a good <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a> editor with a tree view. One that allows you to get a good overview of a JSON structure and make changes to it easily.<br>Yes, I know there's something a bit like that in <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com">Firebug</a> (my favourite bug pesticide) and I did actually find a rather <a href="http://braincast.nl/entry/82/Javascript_JSON_Editor_Part_2">promising attempt</a> by Calm_Pear. But I felt neither  of these were close enough to home,  so  finally I went ahead and wrote <a href="json_editor.html">my own JSON editor</a>.


<h2><a href="form_state.html">Undo &amp; redo in forms</a></h2>
<b>Februari 14, 2007</b><br><br>
Here's a script optimized to make form input undoable/redoable. It's really simply to <a href="form_state.html">apply to any form</a>.

<h2><a href="object_state.html">Something to remember -- Object state</a></h2>
<b>Januari 29, 2007</b><br><br>
A while ago I was writing one of those pesky JavaScript driven webapps where there's a whole lot of undoing going on. The user changes his mind a wants to get back to a previous state -- and the poor programmer has to accommodate. So I was thinking to myself, whilst bumping the back of my head against the stairs (bump, bump, bump): Wouldn't it be nice if I could get a js object to remember its last state and <a href="object_state.html">the state before that and so on</a>?


<h2><a href="mysql_to_json.html">MySQL to JSON</a></h2>
<b>Januari 23, 2007</b><br>
<br>
I confess - I used to loop through my MySQL queries, in my server side language of choice, to build JSON. But there is a far better way that will save you some coding, add to simplicity and might even save some valuable server time. <br>
If you're running MySQL 4.1 or later you can use the nifty function GROUP_CONCAT() together with the normal CONCAT() function to build all your JSON <a href="mysql_to_json.html">straight from your SQL query</a>.


<h2><a href="easier_than_ajax.html">Easier than AJAX</a></h2>
<b>Januari 23, 2007</b><br><br>So you say you want to make remote procedure calls with ease from your web page. Here's an easy way to
get some more javascript functions on your page as they are needed or get som data fragments (JSON?) back from the server.
<br><a href="easier_than_ajax.html">Let's include some js</a>.

<h2><a href="input_control.html">Input control in text fields</a></h2>
<b>September 20, 2006</b><br><br>
One of the projects I'm working on right now involves a lot of form input. So I have come up with a small script to control what a user can write in a text/textarea field.<br>It allows us to control what characters the user is allowed to enter. <a href="input_control.html">Have a look.</a>
<h2><a href="classier_json.html">Classier JSON</a></h2>
<b>August 31, 2006</b><br><br>
I'm back with a more basic, memory efficient and ten times as small script, with a nice prototypal  inheritance pattern. And I steer clear of the Object.prototype too. <br><a href="classier_json.html">To good to be true?</a>

<h2><a href="3_ways_2_say_if.html">3 ways 2 say if</a></h2>
<b>August 25, 2006</b><br><br>
Does <i>"if… else if… else if… else"</i> sound familiar to you? 
<br>I bet it does – it is probably one of the most used structures in programming.  But did you know that there are at least two alternatives to it in JavaScript?<br>Let us take a closer look at the conditional operator and the inner workings of the logical and/or operators -- for a <a href="3_ways_2_say_if.html">leaner & meaner code</a>.

<h2><a href="sorting_things.html">Sorting things</a></h2>
<b>July 29, 2006</b><br><br>
So you have this nice array of objects -- much like a database table -- in JavaScript, but JavaScript's built in array method <b>sort()</b> only works on arrays of strings. How do you sort your objects? <a href="sorting_things.html">Let's sort it out...</a>

<h2><a href="text_color_gradients.html">Create text color gradients</a></h2>
<b>July 20, 2006</b><br><br>
We have seen color gradiented backgrounds on the web for some time now. But here's a new effect for you -- color gradiented text.
I've made a small script (3 kB) that lets you use gradients on your text. It is unobtrusive and really simply to use, no images needed. <a href="text_color_gradients.html">Check it out</a>.

<h2><a href="json_stringify_revisited.html">JSON stringify revisited</a></h2>
<b>July 19, 2006</b><br><br>
To collect your client side JavaScript objects and store  or manipulate them server side (or just have a good look at them while debugging) you need a JSON stringifier. It translates your object structure into a string that can  be evaluated back to the original object. Recently I taught my old stringifier some new exciting tricks -- like how to handle circular references. <a href="json_stringify_revisited.html">Have a look</a> at my interactive example.

<h2><a href="object_prototype_is_erlaubt.html">Object.prototype is erlaubt</a></h2>
<b>July 13, 2006</b><br><br>I heard that extending the JavaScript <a href="http://erik.eae.net/archives/2005/06/06/22.13.54">Object.prototype is verboten</a>. Now, this does not go well with my lazy attitude to programming. But neither does the extra checks needed in your <b>for-in-loops</b> if you extend it. Here's  <a href="object_prototype_is_erlaubt.html">my lazy solution</a>.


<h2><a href="flashpaper_links.html">FlashPaper 2 -- links to internal functions</a></h2>
<b>July 4, 2006</b><br><br>The hyperlinks you create in FlashPaper, via Word, can only point to different web sites. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to point to internal Flash functions as well? Having a link that says "start this part of the program" that really works? I think it would, so I've <a href="flashpaper_links.html">modified</a> Flashpaper's API slightly.


<h2><a href="global_namespace.html">Find your global namespace</a></h2>
<b>June 25, 2006</b><br><br>

Experienced JavaScripters often say that you should not clutter the global namespace. So it would be nice to know just how cluttered your global namespace is, wouldn't it? But finding all the variables in your  global namespace used to be hard, especially in Internet Explorer.  <a href="global_namespace.html">Now I'm making it easy for you</a>.

<h2><a href="classy_json.html">Classy JSON -- why stay single(ton)?</a></h2>
<b>June 9, 2006</b><br>
JSON objects are singleton objects by design, not by choice, since they have no constructor. I really like JSON, but I like classes too. Therefore I have written freeware library called <b>classyJSON</b>. It's small and it's free -- so now there's no excuse not to learn how to <a href="classy_json.html">give your JSON some class</a>.

<h2><a href="when_onload_fails.html">When onload fails</a></h2>
<b>June 9, 2006</b><br>
Opera, Safari and Firefox 1.5 don't trigger the <b>onload</b> event when you hit the back button. This is not a bug -- it is "by design". How do we deal with that? Let me show you <a href="when_onload_fails.html">a nifty little workaround</a>.

<h2><a href="xml_to_json.html">XML to JSON -- a converter</a></h2>
<b>June 8, 2006</b><br>
A while ago I wrote an XML to JSON converter in JavaScript. <a href="xml_to_json.html">Give it a spin</a> and see what you think.
